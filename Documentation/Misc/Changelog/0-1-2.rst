FIX: Import of page used wrong PID
---------------------------------------------
Fix of importing of worng PID. It used the UID of parent, but the parent and translated page should have the same.

FIX: Import of empty strings
---------------------------------------------
Fix of an issue case by <target state="translated" /> which returns array with attributes instead of empty string. That created later HTML input for the import.

FIX: MM relations with opposite fields
---------------------------------------------
Fixed an issue case by opposite field for mm tables. The logic was working like there is not set that opposite field and it returns wrong results from mm table
